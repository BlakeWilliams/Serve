Serve
=====

Serve is a simple command line utility to serve the files in the current
directory via http.

Usage:

```
> serve
> Listening on port 80
```

By default serve listens on port 80, but you can override this by providing
a port number explicitly:

```
> serve 3000
> Listening on port 3000
```
